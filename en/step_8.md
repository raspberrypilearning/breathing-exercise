<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
If you have time, upgrade your firefly project. You could use your project as a room decoration to remind you of nature when you are indoors.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Being in nature</span> is a great way to increase positive feelings and benefit your health. When it isn't possible to get outdoors, you can find ways to bring nature to you; for example, by keeping a houseplant or simulating your own firefly!</p>

You could upgrade your project by:
+ Adding another LED firefly and making it flash in the same pattern.
+ Changing the flash pattern â€” you could research the flash patterns of fireflies in nature.
+ Put your LED firefly in a jar. You could even use conductive thread to hang an LED from the lid.
