The Raspberry Pi Pico is a small device that can be programmed to control electronics components. The Raspberry Pi Pico is a:

--- choices ---

- ( ) microprocessor

  --- feedback ---
Almost, a The Raspberry Pi Pico isn't a microprocessor - though it has one on it! A microprocessor is the chip which controls the logic on a controller or  computer - it's like the brains that does the calculations for a computer to operate.

- ( ) microcomputer

  --- feedback ---
Not quite - a microcomputer is a small device that runs code and can interact with electronics components, but it uses an operating system for user interaction. The Raspberry Pi Pico doesn't have an operating system.

- (x) microcontroller

  --- feedback ---
Yes! The Raspberry Pi Pico is a **microcontroller** - it runs code and interacts with electronics components, but it doesn't have an operating system.

- ( ) microchip

  --- feedback ---
Almost, a microchip is a tiny circuit made up of things called transistors that is attached to a single chip. They are very basic circuits, but lots of them together can make a processor.
