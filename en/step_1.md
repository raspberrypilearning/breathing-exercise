## You will make

In this project, you will use a Raspberry Pi Pico to make an LED firefly that flashes in a particular pattern, just like fireflies in nature, and connect a switch to control the light.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">microcontroller</span> is a tiny computing device that can run code and interact with <span style="color: #0faeb0"> electronics components</span> (such as buttons and lights). It is usually designed to complete a single task, and doesn't have an <span style="color: #0faeb0">operating system</span>. 
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost microcontroller that can be used by beginners and can also be used by experts to develop electronic products.

You will:

+ Meet the Raspberry Pi Pico **microcontroller** 
+ Connect an LED and a switch made from jumper wires to the pins on a **Raspberry Pi Pico** 
+ Program the Raspberry Pi Pico using **MicroPython** and Thonny

This example shows an LED blinking to mimic a real firefly! Can you spot the repeating pattern in the flashes?

To complete this project you will need:

**Hardware**

You can purchase all the required hardware for this project and the other projects in this path from the [Pimoroni web store.](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-intro-kit?variant=39893512945747){:target='_blank'}

If you already have a Raspberry Pi Pico, you can purchase the electronic components you need for this project and the other projects in the path from [The Kitronik web store.](https://kitronik.co.uk/products/5343-raspberry-pi-foundation-pico-pathway-pack)

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on
+ A **data** USB A to micro USB cable
+ 1× yellow LED (or any colour you prefer)
+ 1× 100Ω resistor (any resistor from 75Ω to 220Ω will work)
+ 1× pin–socket jumper wire
+ 3× socket–socket jumper wire
+ Optional: Sticky tape, invisible tape works best

[[[pin-socket-jumper-wires]]]

You can [prepare your LED](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/introduction-to-the-pico){:target="_blank"} in advance by attaching it to a resistor and jumper wires before starting the project. 

**Software**

+ Thonny – this project can be completed using the Thonny Python editor, which can be installed on a Linux, Windows, or Mac computer
