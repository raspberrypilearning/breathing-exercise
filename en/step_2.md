Open the Thonny editor. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Look at the text in the bottom-right corner of the Thonny editor. It will show you the version of Python that is being used.

If it does not say "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)", then click on the text and select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)".

If you have never used MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico, then Thonny will prompt you to add the MicroPython firmware. Click **Install**.

If you see an error message during the install then:
+ Disconnect your Raspberry Pi Pico
+ Reconnect your Raspberry Pi Pico
+ Try to install the firmware again (you might need to press the stop button first)

Make sure your Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to your computer with a micro USB cable. Click on the list in the bottom-right corner of your Thonny window. A pop-up menu will appear, which lists the available interpreters.

If you cannot see the Pico in the list (like in the picture), you will need to reconnect your Raspberry Pi Pico while holding the BOOTSEL button to mount it as a storage volume, and reinstall the firmware by following the instructions in the section above.

You may be using the wrong kind of micro USB cable. Your current micro USB cable may be damaged, or designed only to carry power to devices and cannot transfer data. Try swapping your cable if nothing else has worked. 

If your Pico still won't connect after trying all these things, it may **itself** be damaged and unable to connect.

`picozero` is a MicroPython library for beginners to the Raspberry Pi Pico. 

--- task ---

To complete the projects in this path, you will need to install the `picozero` library as a Thonny package.

In Thonny, choose **Tools** > **Manage packages**.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

In the pop-up 'Manage packages for Raspberry Pi Pico' window, type `picozero` and click **Search on PyPi**.

![Thonny plugins search results showing picozero.](images/thonny-packages-picozero.jpg)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on **picozero** in the search results. 

Click on **Install**.

When installation has completed, close the package window, then exit and reopen Thonny.

--- /task ---

If you have difficulties installing the `picozero` library in Thonny, you can download the library file and save it to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
