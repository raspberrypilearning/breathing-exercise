<span style="color: #0faeb0">MicroPython</span> is a version of the Python programming language for microcontrollers. MicroPython lets you use your Python knowledge to write code to interact with electronics components.</p>

If you have never used MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico, you will need to add the MicroPython firmware.

[[[add-micropython-firmware]]] 

If you are not sure whether you have the firmware installed or you cannot connect, click on the list in the bottom right of your Thonny window. A popup menu will appear listing the available interpreters. [A popup menu showing an option saying configure interpreter](images/no-pico-interpreter.png) If you cannot see the Pico in the list, you will need to reconnect your Raspberry Pi Pico while holding the BOOTSEL button to mount it as a storage volume and reinstall the firmware.
