## Reflection

Well done. You programmed a Raspberry Pi Pico to make an LED flash like a firefly in nature. Now it's time to reflect on the skills that you have gained along the way.

Answer the three questions below to reflect on what you've learnt.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a small device that can be programmed to control electronics components. The Raspberry Pi Pico is a:

--- choices ---

- ( ) microprocessor

  --- feedback ---

Almost, a The Raspberry Pi Pico isn't a microprocessor — although it has one on it! A microprocessor is the chip that controls the logic on a controller or computer — it's like the brains that does the calculations for a computer to operate.

- ( ) microcomputer

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. A microcomputer is a small device that runs code and can interact with electronics components, but it uses an operating system for user interaction. The Raspberry Pi Pico doesn't have an operating system.

- (x) microcontroller

  --- feedback ---

Yes! The Raspberry Pi Pico is a **microcontroller** — it runs code and interacts with electronics components, but it doesn't have an operating system.

- ( ) microchip

  --- feedback ---

Almost, a microchip is a tiny circuit made up of things called transistors that is attached to a single chip. They are very basic circuits, but lots of them together can make a processor.
